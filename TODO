- New setting to custom tag background and text color. I'm considering to make a separate page for SG Game Tags setting.
- New tags (Owned and Not Interested). Requires login to steam with current browser. Cache time 6 hours.
- New button to refresh Bundle, Wishlist, Owned, Not Interested cache.
- New tags (other steam categories, other steam user defined tags). Only by hovering the mouse.


- FAQ in discussion
  1. How to disable tags I don't need?
     > https://www.steamgifts.com/account/settings/giveaways
  2. How to report a problem with this script?
     
  3. The game is bundled but Bundle tag is not showing.
     > There is some reason for this :
       - It's just been bundled less than 6 hours ago.
       - Bug. Report to me if you spot a game with bundle date over than 6 hours ago but the bundle tag isn't showing.
